I am an associate professor in the Department of Political Science at the John D. Rockefeller IV School of Policy and Politics at West Virginia University. I study political inequality, economic disparities, and class politics in the United States. In trying to better understand the relationships among class, inequality, and politics, my research looks at the publicâ€™s attitudes about income inequality and redistribution, the influence of political participation bias on politics and policy, how policy decisions shape economic outcomes, and the role of social class in American politics. My work on class and inequality often focuses on state and local politics and examines policies like taxation, the minimum wage, healthcare, labor policy, and the digital divide.
