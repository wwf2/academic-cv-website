abstract: While most Americans appear to acknowledge the large gap between the rich
  and the poor in the United States, it is not clear whether the public is aware of
  recent changes in income inequality. Even though economic inequality has grown substantially
  in recent decades, studies have shown that the public's perception of growing income
  disparities has remained mostly unchanged since the 1980s. This research offers
  an alternative approach to evaluating how public perceptions of inequality are developed.
  Centrally, it conceptualizes the public's response to growing economic disparities
  by applying theories of macro-political behavior and place-based contextual effects
  to the formation of aggregate perceptions about income inequality. It is argued
  that most of the public relies on basic information about the economy to form attitudes
  about inequality and that geographic context—in this case, the American states—plays
  a role in how views of income disparities are produced. A new measure of state perceptions
  of growing economic inequality over a 25-year period is used to examine whether
  the public is responsive to objective changes in economic inequality. Time-series
  cross-sectional analyses suggest that the public's perceptions of growing inequality
  are largely influenced by objective state economic indicators and state political
  ideology. This research has implications for how knowledgeable the public is of
  disparities between the rich and the poor, whether state context influences attitudes
  about inequality, and what role the public will have in determining how expanding
  income differences are addressed through government policy.
