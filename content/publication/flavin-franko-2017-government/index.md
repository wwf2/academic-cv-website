abstract: "An accumulation of evidence suggests citizens with low incomes have relatively
  little influence over the policy decisions made by lawmakers in the United States.
  However, long before elected officials are asked to cast a final vote on a bill's
  passage, an equally important decision has already been made: the decision for government
  to focus its limited attention and agenda space on the issue at all. Therefore,
  it is possible that political inequality is infused earlier in the policymaking
  process at the agenda-setting stage if the issues held important by some citizens
  are given attention while the issues held important by others are not. To investigate
  this question, we develop novel state-level measures of citizens' issue priorities
  and find sizable differences in which issues poor and rich citizens think are most
  important and deserving of government attention. We then use bill introduction data
  from state legislatures to measure government attention and uncover evidence that
  state legislators are less likely to act on an issue when it is prioritized by low-income
  citizens as compared to affluent citizens. These findings have important implications
  for our understanding of political equality and the functioning of American democracy."
