abstract: This article argues that considering the economic status of various politically
  active groups in society is an important and often overlooked aspect of representation.
  Economic status is linked closely with economic need, which is especially important
  for the disadvantaged. Income affects the types of government programs people are
  influenced by and rely on; for example, government health care and public housing
  policies are more likely to directly influence the poor while those with higher
  economic status may never have an experience with these programs. This suggests
  that different levels of political activity by various groups in society can have
  an influence on lawmakers' decisions regarding how to address certain issues. Using
  a relative index of economic inequalities in participation for each of the 50 states
  over time, I examine whether housing, health care, and wage equity policies are
  more beneficial to the disadvantaged when levels of participation inequality are
  low. Time-series cross-sectional (TSCS) analyses are used to understand the relationship
  between state participation bias and the favorability of policy outcomes for the
  poor. The results of this study have important implications for how political power
  can be used to control the policy process.
