abstract: In an age when the United Nations has declared access to the Internet a
  human right, and universal access to high-speed broadband is a national goal, urban
  areas have been largely ignored by federal policy. The cost of that neglect may
  well be the failure to realize the social benefits of broadband and a broadly-connected
  digital society. Technology offers unparalleled advantages for innovation in urban
  areas - in the economy, health care, education, energy, transportation, government
  services, civic engagement, and more. With their density and networks of activity,
  cities hold the most potential for reaping the benefits of technology. But there
  are surprisingly substantial disparities in broadband adoption across cities. More
  puzzlingly, rather than promoting innovation or addressing the high cost of broadband
  access, the US has mostly funded expensive rural infrastructure in sparsely-populated
  areas. Digital Cities tells the story of information technology use and inequality
  in American metropolitan areas and discusses directions for change. The authors
  argue that mobile-only Internet, the form used by many minorities and urban poor,
  is a second-class form of access, as they offer evidence that users with such limited
  access have dramatically lower levels of online activity and skill. Digital citizenship
  and full participation in economic, social and political life requires home access.
  Using multilevel statistical models, the authors present new data ranking broadband
  access and use in the nation's 50 largest cities and metropolitan areas, showing
  considerable variation across places. Unique, neighborhood data from Chicago examines
  the impact of poverty and segregation on access in a large and diverse city, and
  it parallels analysis of national patterns in urban, suburban and rural areas. Digital
  Cities demonstrate the significance of place for shaping our digital future and
  the need for policies that recognize the critical role of cities in addressing both
  social inequality and opportunity.
