abstract: As levels of residential economic segregation increase in the United States,
  politicians may have greater incentives to focus their attention on the demands
  of those living in wealthier communities at the expense of those living in less
  affluent areas. To better understand the link between economic context and political
  representation, we develop a measure of economic segregation at the local level
  and combine public policy preferences and multiple roll call votes in the House
  of Representatives over several sessions to measure policy responsiveness. Our empirical
  analysis presents evidence that, regardless of one's individual level of income,
  citizens who live in an area of concentrated affluence are better represented by
  their Member of Congress. Conversely, citizens who live in an area of concentrated
  poverty are poorly represented. Importantly, we also show that the disproportionate
  focus affluent areas receive from congressional campaigns and the disproportionate
  campaign contributions that flow from those areas are two possible mechanisms that
  explain the relationship between economic context and political representation.
  These findings suggest that growing residential economic segregation in the United
  States has important implications for our understanding of political equality and
  the responsiveness of elected officials to public opinion.
