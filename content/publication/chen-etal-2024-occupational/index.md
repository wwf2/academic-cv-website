abstract: 'The decades-long rise of economic inequality in the U.S. has led to a growing
  body of literature examining the role of policy in shaping income differences. We
  examine one such policy: occupational licensing regulations. Licensing can restrict
  employment and reduce market competition, which can then inflate wages for those
  in licensed professions. Existing research demonstrates that occupational licensure
  does increase wages in specific industries, leading some scholars to argue that
  licensing makes income inequality worse. We add nuance by arguing that the effect
  of licensing on inequality is dependent on which occupation classes experience the
  largest wage premiums. Using a comprehensive over-time database of state licensing
  regulations, we first demonstrate that medium- and low-wage jobs garner larger wage
  premiums than high-wage occupations. Second, consistent with this result we then
  show that the occupational licensing regulations have the overall effect of reducing
  state income inequality. This research contributes to our understanding of the causes
  of growing inequality and how public policy can shape economic disparities through
  sometimes unintended and indirect ways.'
