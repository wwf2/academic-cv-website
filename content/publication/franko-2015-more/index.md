abstract: Inequality in political participation is a well-known and often studied
  feature of American politics. An important study examining misreporting of voter
  turnout in opinion surveys, however, calls into question the true extent of participation
  inequality. Ansolabehere and Hersh's first-ever 50-state vote validation project
  shows that those with more political resources are more likely to misreport turnout.
  That is, those with higher incomes are more likely than others to report that they
  had voted when in fact they did not. These findings suggest that income disparities
  in participation are not as large as opinion surveys have led us to believe. Moreover,
  studies using differences between voters and nonvoters as a key political indicator
  may also be biased. This article presents the first assessment of whether vote misreporting
  creates systematic bias in measures of state participation inequality. An index
  of economic inequality in participation for the 50 states is developed using the
  Ansolabehere and Hersh validated vote data and compares the measure of political
  inequality with a similar measure using traditional (i.e., nonvalidated) survey
  data. These state indices are used to determine the extent of bias produced by misreporting
  and whether this bias has implications for studies using these measures of participation
  inequality. The latter is assessed by examining the influence of the self-reported
  and validated inequality measures on state welfare programs and minimum wage policy.
