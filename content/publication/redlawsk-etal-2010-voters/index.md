abstract: Social desirability effects make it difficult to learn voters' racial attitudes.
  List experiments can tap sensitive issues without directly asking respondents to
  express overt opinions. The authors report on such an experiment about Barack Obama
  as the first black president, finding that 30 percent of white Americans were ``troubled''
  by the prospect of Obama as the first black president. The authors examine policy
  and emotional underpinnings of these responses, finding that expressed emotions
  of anxiety and enthusiasm condition latent racial attitudes and racial policy beliefs
  especially for those exhibiting a social desirability bias. The results suggest
  that Obama's victory despite this level of concern about race was at least in part
  a result of intense enthusiasm his campaign generated. This enthusiasm for Obama
  may have allowed some white voters to overcome latent concerns about his race. The
  research suggests emotions are critical in understanding racial attitudes.
