abstract: This study assesses whether local economic segregation, or the degree to
  which people live among others of similar economic status, influences the American
  public's preferences for government redistribution. To test this proposition, we
  combine unique measures of economic segregation at the local level (using zip codes),
  covering nearly the entire U.S. population, with individual-level opinions on government
  spending and taxation. Multilevel regression analysis with random intercepts is
  used to assess whether the public's preferences for redistribution are shaped by
  local economic segregation. Our findings suggest that residents living in highly
  segregated areas are less likely to favor redistributive government policy. Additionally,
  the results show that the influence of economic segregation on public support for
  redistribution is particularly strong among the affluent. This research not only
  contributes to our understanding of the consequences of economic change, but it
  also demonstrates the importance of considering local context when studying the
  attitudes of the American public. While the expansion of income inequality is certainly
  a global phenomenon, the political, economic, and social environments that make
  up the communities where people live are bound to have an influence on public opinion.
