abstract: The mass franchise led to more responsive government and a more equitable
  distribution of resources in the United States and other democracies. Recently in
  America, however, voter participation has been low and increasingly biased toward
  the wealthy. We investigate whether this electoral ``class bias'' shapes government
  ideology, the substance of economic policy, and distributional outcomes, thereby
  shedding light on both the old question of whether who votes matters and the newer
  question of how politics has contributed to growing income inequality. Because both
  lower and upper income groups try to use their resources to mobilize their supporters
  and demobilize their opponents, we argue that variation in class bias in turnout
  is a good indicator of the balance of power between upper and lower income groups.
  And because lower income voters favor more liberal governments and economic policies
  we expect that less class bias will be associated with these outcomes and a more
  equal income distribution. Our analysis of data from the U.S. states confirms that
  class bias matters for these outcomes.
