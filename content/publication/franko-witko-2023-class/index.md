abstract: In the Post-industrial Era, there has been an apparent weakening of the
  relationship between class and voting in the U.S., with lower class voters becoming
  less likely to support the Democratic Party. We argue that this reflects that lower
  class status predicts liberal economic attitudes, but conservative views on cultural
  and racial issues, while the parties are consistently liberal or conservative, creating
  conflicts for many voters. How do voters settle such internal conflicts? We argue
  that the salience that voters attach to these different types of issues determines
  how policy attitudes, and indirectly class, shapes voting. Using ANES and GSS data
  since the 1970s, we find that class consistently predicts economic and cultural/minority
  policy attitudes, and that lower class voters who place more salience on economic
  issues, and upper class voters for whom cultural issues are more salient, are more
  likely to support the Democratic Party in presidential elections.
