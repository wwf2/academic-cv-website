abstract: "While most Americans appear to acknowledge the large gap between the rich
  and the poor in the United States, it is not clear how the public has responded
  to recent changes in income inequality. The goal of this study is to make sense
  of several existing, and at times conflicting, perspectives on how changes in inequality
  affect public preferences for government action, by demonstrating that each of these
  perspectives can simultaneously coexist in a logical manner. The argument put forward
  here is that growing inequality systematically shapes preferences for redistribution
  in different ways, depending on two important factors: economic context and the
  type of redistribution being considered. Using time-series cross-sectional data
  covering over three decades and all 50 states, the findings show that context does
  affect the degree of the public's response to inequality and that support for action
  is stronger for particular types of redistributive policy."
