abstract: Influential economic models predict that as inequality increases, the public
  will demand greater redistribution. However, there is limited research into the
  determinants of support for redistributive tax increases because such proposals
  have been so rare in America in recent decades. We use Washington State's Proposition
  1098 to examine how economic self-interest, concerns about inequality, and partisanship
  influence support for redistributive taxation. The results show that all of these
  factors influenced support, with strong support among the lower income, indicating
  that when the distributional implications of policies are clear, citizens can translate
  their self-interest and broad attitudes into congruent redistributive preferences.
