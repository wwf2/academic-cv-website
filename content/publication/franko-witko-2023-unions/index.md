abstract: Compared to other Western democracies, in the United States fewer people
  subjectively identify as working class historically and many working-class individuals
  think of themselves as middle class. This likely has important political implications.
  We argue, however, that union membership can strengthen identification with the
  working class, through communications from leaders and interactions among members.
  Using General Social Survey data from five decades, we develop an original multi-indicator
  IRT-based measure of objective class status and find that union membership makes
  it more likely that individuals identify as working class, across all objective
  class groups. Panel data analysis shows that union membership predicts future working-class
  identification but that the opposite is not true, suggesting that these associations
  are causal. Finally, we show that identifying with the working rather than middle
  or upper class is associated with more support for redistribution and the welfare
  state.
