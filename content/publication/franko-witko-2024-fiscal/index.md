abstract: The intricacies of budget processes and procedures may initially appear
  mind-numbingly boring to even a passionate student of politics, but decisions about
  taxing and spending touch on core questions in political science and public policy
  about which actors in the polity hold power. The political scientist Harold Lasswell
  famously defined politics as ``who gets what, when and how.'' Very few decisions
  touch on these core questions as clearly as budgets, which are essentially collective
  authoritative decisions made about who and what activities will provide the resources
  for government and on whom and what these revenues will be spent. Indeed, because
  they take scarce resources and allocate them toward essentially infinite potential
  social needs and policy problems, budgets are also succinct statements about the
  priorities of governments and the values of societies. Therefore, understanding
  taxing and spending decisions is central to understanding politics and public policy.
