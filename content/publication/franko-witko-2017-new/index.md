abstract: Donald Trump's 2016 victory shocked the world, but his appeals to the economic
  discontent of the white working class should not be so surprising, as stagnant wages
  for the many have been matched with skyrocketing incomes for the few. Though Trump
  received high levels of support from the white working class, once in office, the
  newly elected billionaire president appointed a cabinet with a net worth greater
  than one-third of American households combined. Furthermore, he pursued traditionally
  conservative tax, welfare state and regulatory policies, which are likely to make
  economic disparities worse. Nevertheless, income inequality has grown over the last
  few decades almost regardless of who is elected to the presidency and congress.
  There is a growing consensus among scholars that one of the biggest drivers of income
  inequality in the United States is government activity (or inactivity). Just as
  the New Deal and Great Society programs played a key role in leveling income distribution
  from the 1930s through the 1970s, federal policy since then has contributed to expanding
  inequality. Growing inequality bolsters the resources of the wealthy leading to
  greater influence over policy, and it contributes to partisan polarization. Both
  prevent the passage of policy to address inequality, creating a continuous feedback
  loop of growing inequality. The authors of this book argue that it is therefore
  misguided to look to the federal government, as citizens have tended to do since
  the New Deal, to lead on economic policy to \"fix\" inequality. In fact, they argue
  that throughout American history, during periods of rapid economic change the federal
  government has been stymied by the federal institutional design created by the Constitution.
  The winners of economic change have taken advantage of veto points to prevent change
  that would address the problems experienced by the losers of major economic change.
  Even the New Deal, in many ways the model of federal policy activism, was largely
  borrowed from policies created in the state \"laboratories of democracy\" in the
  preceding years and decades. The authors argue that in the current crisis of growing
  inequality we are seeing a similar dynamic and demonstrate that many states are
  actively addressing economic inequality. William Franko and Christopher Witko argue
  that the states that will address inequality are not necessarily those with the
  greatest objective inequality, but those where citizens are aware of growing inequality,
  where left-leaning politicians hold power, where unions are strong, and where the
  presence of direct democracy allow for more majoritarian public policy outcomes.
  In the empirical chapters Franko and Witko examine how these factors have shaped
  policies that boosted incomes at the bottom (the minimum wage and the Earned Income
  Tax Credit) and reduce incomes at the top (with top marginal tax rates) between
  1987 and 2010. The authors argue that, if history is a guide, increasingly egalitarian
  policies at the state level will spread to other states and, eventually, to the
  federal level, setting the stage for a more equitable future.
summary: |-
  In the *The New Economic Populism: How States Respond to Economic Inequality* ([Oxford](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-new-economic-populism-9780190671013?cc=us&lang=en&) | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/New-Economic-Populism-Respond-Inequality/dp/0190671017)), we argue that the U.S. government’s failure to address rising income inequality should not be very surprising since federal inaction in the face of emerging economic problems is the norm in American history. The states led the fight against new economic problems during the Progressive Era and Great Depression, and it is likely that we will once again have to rely on the states to address today’s massive gap between the rich and the poor. We show that the public is cognizant of rising inequality and that this growing awareness is associated with more egalitarian political and policy changes. In contrast to the prevailing pessimism regarding income inequality, we suggest that if history is a guide these incipient state actions to reduce inequality are likely to spread to other states and even the federal government in the coming decades.
