abstract: 'Context: Deaths of despair, a term used to capture rising mortality rates
  among Americans who appear to be suffering from growing mental and physical distress,
  have received added attention from those seeking to understand this disturbing trend.
  Yet it is unclear how, if at all, despair influences the political behavior of the
  people and communities where it is most prominent. The authors contribute to the
  health and politics literature by examining whether personal and community-level
  despair shapes political participation.Methods: The authors examine the relationship
  between despair and voter turnout using novel data at both the aggregate and individual
  levels. First, a custom survey is used to test whether despair is associated with
  individual-level voter participation in several recent elections. Second, a new
  measure of community despair is developed at the county level that spans nearly
  20 years to assess whether there is a relationship between despair and voter turnout
  in U.S counties.Findings: The results suggest that higher levels of despair lead
  to lower turnout rates at both the individual and community levels.Conclusions:
  This study suggests that the effects of experiencing despair are far reaching and
  shape political behavior among individuals and within communities.'
